# Self-Balancing-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino-robot
The purpose of this project is to create a fun self balancing robot that is processed locally on an arduino to make deecsions regarding the PID and then much more intensive decsions will be made on the raspbery pi such as image tracking. They will be interacting over I2C where the arduino will be sending serial code over the serial monitor to the raspberry pi and then the raspberry pi can control it from there.
