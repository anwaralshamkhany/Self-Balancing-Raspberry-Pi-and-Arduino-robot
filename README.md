# Self-Balancing-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino-robot
The purpose of this project is to create a fun self balancing robot that is processed locally on an arduino to make deecsions regarding the PID and then much more intensive decsions will be made on the raspbery pi such as image tracking. They will be interacting over I2C
